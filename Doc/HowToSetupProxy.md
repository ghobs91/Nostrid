# How to configure a proxy

Nostrid can route its traffic through a proxy, including through Tor.

Follow these steps to configure a proxy:

1. In the main menu, go to `Settings`
2. Go to `Proxy`
3. Enter proxy URI, for example for Tor it should be `socks5://127.0.0.1:9150`
4. Optionally enter username and password if required by proxy
5. Press `Apply`
